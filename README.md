Made using Unity 2019.4.8f1

## About

This is a game prototype where you control the cube that constantly falls down in an endless space tower with platforms. The game has a high score that is saved to the binary file.

## Design decisions

I made the camera orthographic as I feel this type of game is best with such camera. However, you can change the camera to perspective and play just fine.
